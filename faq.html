              "text": "Floating wetlands are buoyant platforms planted with emergent wetland plants. The plants grow hydroponically, sending roots down into the water column. Those roots get colonized by biofilm, a dense microbial community that traps and processes pollutants including nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids. Research shows approximately 80% of the treatment comes from this biofilm activity, with about 20% from direct plant uptake. The root zone also provides habitat for invertebrates and juvenile fish, creating a self-sustaining aquatic ecosystem."

              "text": "Coverage depends on your goals. For fisheries and habitat enhancement, 2-3% of your pond's surface area is a research-backed starting point, based on replicated trials showing 19.9% greater fish biomass at just 2.3% coverage. For general water quality improvement and algae reduction, 5-10% coverage is the standard recommendation from Clemson University and NC State Extension research. For aggressive nutrient removal in high-load systems, 10% or more is appropriate. Our free sizing calculator at calculator.floatingwetlands.com helps you determine exact module counts based on your pond dimensions and goals."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Chemical algaecides provide fast results but require repeated applications, typically multiple times per growing season, and they kill beneficial organisms including the zooplankton that naturally graze on algae. Floating wetlands take longer to establish but become more effective over time as biofilm communities mature. They address the root cause of algae, excess nutrients, rather than just killing algae after it appears. Research from multiple university programs documents a 4-13 year cost breakeven versus ongoing chemical treatment, after which floating wetlands continue working with minimal cost. Unlike chemicals, floating wetlands also provide fish habitat, pollinator habitat, and aesthetic value."

Common choices include soft rush (Juncus effusus), blue flag iris (Iris versicolor), pickerelweed (Pontederia cordata), sedges (Carex spp.), and switchgrass (Panicum virgatum). For maximum nutrient uptake, prioritize species with dense, fast-growing root systems. Avoid trees and large shrubs as their weight can sink the mat. We help customers select species suited to their specific region, hardiness zone, and water quality goals."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Floating wetlands can be anchored to the shoreline using earth anchors and rope, or in deeper water using concrete blocks, plow anchors, or dock cleats on the bottom. The system rises and falls with fluctuating water levels, up to 2 meters. Anchoring should allow for seasonal water level changes while keeping the island in the desired location. After strong storms, it is a good practice to inspect anchoring to make sure everything is secure."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Yes. Floating wetland modules are designed to withstand repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The plants go dormant in winter just like natural wetland vegetation and return in spring. In northern climates, the island may freeze into the ice surface and thaw out in spring with no damage. Treatment capacity is reduced during dormancy, but this coincides with lower biological activity and nutrient loading in the water body. No removal is required for winter."

              "text": "High-quality floating wetland modules are constructed from UV-stabilized, marine-grade materials designed for long-term outdoor water exposure. The Atlan modules use durable, non-toxic construction rated for years of continuous deployment. Treatment performance actually improves over time as root systems expand, biofilm communities diversify, and the ecosystem matures. Annual maintenance involves trimming plant material in late winter before spring growth, removing invasive volunteer species, and inspecting anchors."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Floating wetlands are low maintenance compared to most water treatment systems. Once per year, typically in late winter or early spring, cut back dead plant material above the mat and remove it from the water body. This prevents nutrients from cycling back into the water and encourages vigorous spring growth. Check anchoring after major storms. Remove any volunteer invasive species or tree seedlings that appear on the mat, as trees can sink the island. Do not apply fertilizers or herbicides to floating wetlands. After the first growing season, quarterly visual inspections are sufficient."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Yes. Several states now recognize floating wetlands as a retrofit strategy for stormwater ponds. North Carolina's Stormwater Control Measure Credit Document awards total nitrogen and total phosphorus credits when floating wetlands cover at least 5% of a wet pond's permanent pool surface area. Other states and municipalities are developing similar frameworks. Floating wetlands can be deployed in existing ponds without reducing storage capacity or modifying dam structures, making them an attractive retrofit option for ponds that are not meeting current water quality standards."

              "text": "University research documents removal of nitrogen (70-97%), phosphorus (83-96%), and total suspended solids (87-95%). Floating wetlands also reduce biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), improve dissolved oxygen levels, and have been shown to reduce heavy metals and coliform bacteria in some applications. The primary removal mechanisms are microbial processing in root zone biofilm, direct plant uptake, and enhanced sedimentation as suspended particles are trapped by the dense root network."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "A minimum depth of 3 feet (about 1 meter) is recommended. This prevents plant roots from reaching the bottom and rooting into the sediment, which would reduce the free-floating root zone that drives treatment performance. Deeper water is fine. Floating wetlands are particularly useful in ponds that are too deep for traditional rooted wetland vegetation, which typically requires water depths under 20 inches."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Fish generally do not damage floating wetlands. The plant roots grow down through the mat and into the water, where they become colonized by biofilm and invertebrates that fish actually feed on. Juvenile fish use the root zone as a nursery habitat, sheltering from predators. Research from Neal and Lloyd (2018) documented 19.9% greater total fish biomass in ponds with floating wetlands at just 2.3% surface coverage. The islands benefit fish populations rather than competing with them."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "No. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant, shallow water. Floating wetlands sit on deeper open water where fish actively feed on mosquito larvae. The root zone habitat supports fish populations that are natural mosquito predators. Additionally, the biofilm and invertebrate communities beneath the island include organisms that consume mosquito larvae. Properly deployed floating wetlands can actually help reduce mosquito populations by supporting the predator community."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Yes, floating wetlands work well in koi ponds and water gardens. They provide shade that helps control water temperature and algae growth, while the roots absorb excess nutrients from fish waste. The floating mat protects the plants from being eaten by koi, which are known for destroying rooted pond plants. Smaller modular systems are ideal for water gardens because you can start with a few modules and expand as needed."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Plants begin growing roots through the mat within weeks of installation. Biofilm colonization starts almost immediately once roots enter the water. Measurable nutrient removal typically begins within the first growing season. However, floating wetlands are not an overnight solution. Full treatment capacity develops over one to three growing seasons as root systems expand, biofilm communities mature, and the supporting food web establishes. Performance continues to improve over time, unlike chemical treatments that degrade and require reapplication."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Yes, this is one of their key advantages over constructed wetlands. Because floating wetlands are anchored rather than fixed, they can be repositioned if water quality conditions change, if construction or dredging is needed, or if you want to adjust the layout. Modules can also be connected into larger configurations or separated into smaller units. This flexibility makes them particularly useful in dynamic environments."

              "text": "Floating wetlands use non-toxic, environmentally safe materials and do not introduce chemicals into the water. However, for safety reasons you should not swim underneath floating wetlands. The underwater root systems and anchor lines could present an entanglement hazard. Position islands away from swimming areas and ensure they are clearly visible. The water quality improvements from floating wetlands can actually benefit swimming areas by reducing nutrient levels and algae growth."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Floating planters are small decorative containers that hold a single potted plant on the water surface. They add visual interest but provide minimal water quality benefit because the roots stay contained in the pot. Floating treatment wetlands are engineered platforms where plant roots grow directly through the mat and into the water column, creating extensive underwater surface area for biofilm colonization. This free-hanging root architecture is what drives nutrient removal, fish habitat creation, and ecosystem development. The treatment value comes from the root-to-water contact that planters do not provide."

              "@type": "Answer",
              "text": "Permit requirements vary by jurisdiction and the type of water body. Private ponds on your own property typically do not require permits. Stormwater ponds managed by HOAs or municipalities may need approval from the managing authority. Public waters, navigable waterways, and waters regulated under the Clean Water Act may require permits from state environmental agencies or the Army Corps of Engineers. Check with your local regulatory authority before installing in any publicly managed water body. We can help you navigate this process."

        Floating wetlands are buoyant platforms planted with emergent wetland plants. The plants grow hydroponically, sending roots down into the water column. Those roots get colonized by <strong>biofilm</strong>, a dense microbial community that traps and processes pollutants including nitrogen, phosphorus, and suspended solids. Research shows approximately <strong>80% of the treatment comes from this biofilm activity</strong>, with about 20% from direct plant uptake (<a href="https://lgpress.clemson.edu/publication/an-introduction-to-floating-wetlands-for-stormwater-ponds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clemson LGP 1185</a>). The root zone also provides habitat for invertebrates and juvenile fish, creating a self-sustaining aquatic ecosystem.

        Floating planters are small decorative containers that hold a potted plant on the water surface. They look nice but provide minimal water quality benefit because the roots stay contained in the pot. <strong>Floating treatment wetlands</strong> are engineered platforms where plant roots grow directly through the mat and into the water column, creating extensive underwater surface area for biofilm colonization. This free-hanging root architecture is what drives nutrient removal, fish habitat creation, and ecosystem development. The treatment value comes from the root-to-water contact that planters simply do not provide.

        Chemical algaecides provide fast results but require repeated applications, often multiple times per growing season, and they kill beneficial organisms including the zooplankton that naturally graze on algae. Floating wetlands take longer to establish but <strong>become more effective over time</strong> as biofilm communities mature. They address the root cause of algae (excess nutrients) rather than just killing algae after it appears. University research documents a <strong>4-13 year cost breakeven</strong> versus ongoing chemical treatment, after which floating wetlands continue working with minimal cost. Unlike chemicals, floating wetlands also provide fish habitat, pollinator habitat, and aesthetic value. <a href="/food-chain">Read the full science on how the underwater ecosystem controls algae naturally.</a>

        Plants begin growing roots through the mat within weeks of installation. Biofilm colonization starts almost immediately once roots enter the water. Measurable nutrient removal typically begins within the first growing season. Full treatment capacity develops over <strong>one to three growing seasons</strong> as root systems expand, biofilm communities mature, and the supporting food web establishes. Unlike chemical treatments that degrade and require reapplication, floating wetland performance <strong>continues to improve over time</strong>.

        A minimum depth of <strong>3 feet (about 1 meter)</strong> is recommended. This prevents plant roots from reaching the bottom and rooting into the sediment, which would reduce the free-floating root zone that drives treatment performance. Deeper water is fine. Floating wetlands are particularly useful in ponds that are too deep for traditional rooted wetland vegetation, which typically requires water depths under 20 inches.

        Floating wetlands can be anchored to the shoreline using <strong>earth anchors and rope</strong>, or in deeper water using <strong>concrete blocks, plow anchors, or dock cleats</strong> on the bottom. The system rises and falls with fluctuating water levels, up to 2 meters. Anchoring should allow for seasonal water level changes while keeping the island positioned where you want it.

      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        The best time to plant and launch floating wetlands is during the <strong>active growing season</strong>, typically May through September in northern climates. This gives plants a full season to establish root systems before winter dormancy. Earlier planting within this window allows more time for establishment. In southern regions with longer growing seasons, the installation window extends accordingly.

        Yes, and this is one of their key advantages over constructed wetlands. Because floating wetlands are anchored rather than fixed, they can be <strong>repositioned</strong> if water quality conditions change, if construction or dredging is needed, or if you want to adjust the layout. Modules can also be connected into larger configurations or separated into smaller units. This flexibility makes them particularly useful in dynamic environments.

        Floating wetlands are low maintenance compared to most water treatment systems. <strong>Once per year</strong>, typically in late winter or early spring, cut back dead plant material above the mat and remove it from the water body. This prevents nutrients from cycling back into the water and encourages vigorous spring growth. Check anchoring after major storms. Remove any volunteer invasive species or tree seedlings that appear on the mat, since trees can sink the island. <strong>Do not apply fertilizers or herbicides</strong> to floating wetlands. After the first growing season, quarterly visual inspections are sufficient (<a href="https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/maintaining-your-floating-wetland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clemson maintenance guide</a>).

In northern climates, the island may freeze into the ice surface and thaw out in spring with no damage. Treatment capacity is reduced during dormancy, but this coincides with lower biological activity and nutrient loading in the water body. <strong>No removal is required for winter.</strong>

        Floating wetlands reduce the conditions that cause algae blooms by removing excess nutrients from the water. They also support zooplankton populations that naturally graze on algae. However, they are part of a comprehensive water management approach, not a silver bullet. In ponds with severe nutrient loading from ongoing sources (fertilizer runoff, waterfowl waste, septic influence), you may also need to address the nutrient sources. The right coverage percentage combined with good watershed management practices can dramatically reduce algae problems. <a href="/food-chain">Learn how the underwater food chain controls algae.</a>

        Can I use floating wetlands in a koi pond or water garden?

        Yes. Floating wetlands work well in koi ponds and water gardens. They provide shade that helps control water temperature and algae growth, while the roots absorb excess nutrients from fish waste. The floating mat <strong>protects the plants from being eaten by koi</strong>, which are notorious for destroying rooted pond plants. Modular systems are ideal for water gardens because you can start with a few modules and expand as needed.

        Are floating wetlands safe near swimming areas?

      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        Floating wetlands use non-toxic, environmentally safe materials and do not introduce chemicals into the water. However, for safety reasons <strong>do not swim underneath floating wetlands</strong>. The underwater root systems and anchor lines could present an entanglement hazard. Position islands away from swimming areas and ensure they are clearly visible. The water quality improvements from floating wetlands can actually benefit nearby swimming areas by reducing nutrient levels and algae growth.

        Do floating wetlands attract mosquitoes?

      </div>
      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        No. Mosquitoes breed in stagnant, shallow water. Floating wetlands sit on deeper open water where fish actively feed on mosquito larvae. The root zone habitat supports fish populations that are <strong>natural mosquito predators</strong>. The biofilm and invertebrate communities beneath the island also include organisms that consume mosquito larvae. Properly deployed floating wetlands can actually help reduce mosquito populations by strengthening the predator community.

        Will fish eat the plants or damage the modules?

      </div>
      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        Fish generally do not damage floating wetlands. The plant roots grow through the mat and into the water where they become colonized by biofilm and invertebrates that fish actively feed on. Juvenile fish use the root zone as a <strong>nursery habitat</strong>, sheltering from predators among the roots. Research documented 19.9% greater total fish biomass in ponds with floating wetlands. The islands benefit fish populations rather than competing with them.

      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        Permit requirements vary by jurisdiction and the type of water body. <strong>Private ponds on your own property typically do not require permits.</strong> Stormwater ponds managed by HOAs or municipalities may need approval from the managing authority. Public waters, navigable waterways, and waters regulated under the Clean Water Act may require permits from state environmental agencies or the Army Corps of Engineers. Check with your local regulatory authority before installing in any publicly managed water body. We can help you navigate this process.

      <div class="faq-a"><div class="faq-a-inner">
        Yes. Several states now recognize floating wetlands as a retrofit strategy for stormwater ponds. <strong>North Carolina's Stormwater Control Measure Credit Document</strong> awards total nitrogen and total phosphorus credits when floating wetlands cover at least 5% of a wet pond's permanent pool surface area (<a href="https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/installation-and-maintenance-of-floating-treatment-wetlands" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NC State AG-588-29</a>). Other states and municipalities are developing similar frameworks. Floating wetlands can be deployed in existing ponds <strong>without reducing storage capacity</strong> or modifying dam structures, making them an attractive retrofit option for ponds that are not meeting current water quality standards.
